This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...
 
Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!
 
Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes 
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs
 
The release team should empty this file after each release.

The development team decided to exclude translations which are not properly finished from releases. The corresponding PO files will however stay in the git master version. The selection will be done based on the percentage of translated and fuzzy strings since we are lacking detailed knowledge about the languages in question.
